# Work Of Art Or Not
## 人工只能生成物是否构成作品

Is an AI-generated work considered a work of art? The controversy lies in whether human intelligence is reflected in the creation process of the generated material.

According to Article 3 of the Copyright Law of the People's Republic of China, a work has two characteristics: it must have originality and it must be an intellectual achievement. The originality of a work in the context of copyright law means that it is created independently by the author and reflects the author's unique selection and arrangement of the material used in the creation process. In other words, a work is created independently by the author and is not copied from others. In addition, this also includes the fact that if someone creates something using certain rules or algorithms and only comes up with the same expression, this expression is not a work, for example, a telephone directory is not considered a work. Although intellectual achievements are non-material, they need to be expressed through material means, otherwise, even if it is an intellectual achievement, it cannot be considered a work.

In my opinion, the criterion for determining whether an AI-generated work belongs to the category of works of art is based on the main elements that determine the nature of the work, which is who is responsible for the selection, arrangement, and combination of the material. For example, if there is an AI-generated novel, the core of a novel as a work of art lies in its unique plot and the author's thoughts and emotions. The plot is imagined or written based on the author's actual experiences, expressing the author's unique emotions. All the ideas are directed by the author, and the AI is only responsible for writing the outline, arranging the plot logically, devising names for characters and places, and combining, splitting, and polishing the text according to the author's instructions. In this case, an AI-generated work can be considered a work of art, and the copyright owner is naturally the author. In the cases of the database and Nanshan Court reports, the works are data reports, and the core lies in the data. Therefore, I believe that to determine whether it belongs to the category of works, we need to judge from the data and conclusions in the article. If the collection and screening of the data is done by humans, and the AI is used for data verification and drawing graphs, and the final conclusions are drawn by humans based on the processed data, then this process reflects human intelligence, expresses the author's central idea, and has the characteristics of a work.

AI生成物是否构成作品，这个问题的争议焦点在于人类的智慧成果是否体现在生成物的形成过程中。
根据《中华人民共和国著作权法》第3条规定，作品有两个特点，第一个是需要具备独创性，第二它需要是一种智力成果。著作权法意义上的独创性，是指作品为作者独立完成并能体现作者对创作的素材进行特有的选择与安排。也就是说，作品是由作者独立创作的，非抄袭他人而成。除此之外，其含义还包括，如果某人仅仅只是按照一定的规则、程式进行创作，只能得出同样的表达，这个表达不是作品, 例如电话簿就不属于作品。智力成果尽管是非物质性的，其需要通过物质予以表达，否则仅仅是智力成果也不能认为是一种作品。
我认为认定AI生成物是否属于作品的判断标准在于决定该作品性质的主要元素，是看由谁来进行选择、编排、结合的。举个例子，假如存在一部AI生成的小说，小说这种作品的核心是其独特的情节和作者的思想情感，情节是由当事人想象而成或根据自己实际经历撰写的，表达了作者独特的情感，所有的构思的落实都是由当事人主导，而AI只是负责撰写大纲，进行小说情节逻辑编排，替作者拟定人名、地名，根据当事人的指令对文本进行结合、拆分、润色等，这样的情况下，AI生成物是能够构成作品的，且其著作权人当然而然属于这个当事人。数据库案和南山法院案的作品都是数据报告，其核心是数据，那么我认为要认定这个是否属于作品，就要从文章中的数据和结论来着手判断。假如数据的采集、筛选是由人来进行的，借助AI进行数据的真实性检验和绘图表、分点论述，自然人根据处理好的数据得出最终结论，那么这个过程就凝结了人的智力成果，表达了作者的中心思想，从而具有作品的特征。
